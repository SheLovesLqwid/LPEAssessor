LPEAssessor is a comprehensive Linux privilege escalation VAPT Framework designed for security professionals, system administrators, and penetration testers. It systematically identifies potential privilege escalation vectors, verifies their exploitability, and provides detailed industry-compliant reports, in both easily parsable format (.TXT, .JSON) and overview-friendly format (.HTML), with actionable dynamically-generated remediations, working across multiple Linux distributions and enviroments.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Detects 17+ types of privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- **Real-time Verification**: Verifies vulnerabilities with dynamic vulnerability type-based exploits and commands to minimize false positives (63% less false positives than in version 1.3.1)
- **Advanced Exploitation**: Generates practical exploitation commands with multiple approaches, including comprehensive GTFOBins techniques for SUID/SGID binaries
- **Path Hijacking Analysis**: Sophisticated path manipulation vulnerability detection
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: Optional monitoring for privileged execution of hijacked binaries
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates detailed HTML, JSON, and text reports
- **Threading Support**: Multithreaded scanning for improved performance
- **System Compatibility**: Works across various Linux distributions

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ParzivalHack/LPEAssessor.git
cd LPEAssessor
```

# Usage

```
# Basic scan with default options
python LPEAssessor.py

# Generate a report in all formats (HTML, JSON, text)
python LPEAssessor.py -o report

# Verbose output with custom log file
python LPEAssessor.py -v -l assessment.log

# Increase number of scanning threads
python LPEAssessor.py -t 20

# Skip information gathering and exploit generation
python LPEAssessor.py --skip-info --skip-exploits

# Monitor for successful path hijacking exploits
python LPEAssessor.py --monitor-only --monitor-timeout 600
```
